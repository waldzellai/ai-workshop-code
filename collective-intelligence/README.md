# Collective Intelligence Integration

This repository has been enhanced with collective intelligence telemetry to participate in a learning network of AI-powered scripts.

## Features

- **Performance Tracking**: Automatic monitoring of script execution times, resource usage, and success rates
- **Pattern Detection**: Identification of successful strategies and optimization opportunities
- **Cross-Repository Learning**: Sharing of discoveries and best practices across the network
- **Autonomous Evolution**: Self-improvement based on collective experience

## Configuration

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and configure your Supabase credentials
2. Set `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true` to activate data collection
3. Scripts will automatically report telemetry data

## Privacy

- All user data is anonymized
- Telemetry focuses on performance metrics, not sensitive data
- Opt-out available by setting `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`
